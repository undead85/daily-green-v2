# daily-green-v2

Our website introduces a story-based quiz in which you spend one day making small life choices and learning everyday tips to live a sustainable life. The project teaches people that small actions you can do every day can help combat climate change.
Our team wanted to make a fun game while teaching others some interesting facts about sustainable life choices. 

We used a .NET framework, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

One of the most difficult parts to implement was making the user interface look good. We didn't have a UI/UX designer on our team so we had to improvise.

The next steps of this project require us to keep developing additional features. We'd like to connect the game with links and some API data to learn more about what you can do to combat climate change. We also plan to improve the UI/UX by adding more choices, animations and making the websie easier to navigate.
